                <h4>How I stay committed to learning</h4>
                <p class="article-main">
                    I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then
                    try
                    to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
                </p>
                <p class="article-main">
                    While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things
                    about my journey with the world.
                </p>
                <h4>How I got started</h4>
                <p class="article-main">
                    I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I
                    was
                    learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned
                    but
                    also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
                </p>
                <p class="article-main">
                    That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was
                    also
                    helping others learn and stay motivated.
